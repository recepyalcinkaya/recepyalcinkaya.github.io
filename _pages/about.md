I am a senior Computer Engineering student at Pamukkale University, graduating this year. My primary career objective is to develop cutting-edge software solutions within the automotive sector.

I currently serve as the Head of the Software Unit and the ADAS & Autonomous Software Lead for the **ATAY** team, our university's electric and autonomous vehicle community. Every year, we develop our electromobile, *'Alatay'*, and compete in the TEKNOFEST International Efficiency Challenge Electric Vehicle Races, consistently achieving high ranks. Bridging software architecture with physical hardware integration to create real-world automotive solutions is where I thrive.
